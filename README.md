<p align='center'><b>AIQC is a Python framework for rapid & reproducible deep learning.</b></p>

![Framework](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aiqc/aiqc/main/docs/images/framework_diagram_april16.png)

<p align='center'><b>On a mission to accelerate open science.</b></p>

* Reduce the programming & data science know-how required to adopt deep learning.
* Open source methodologies instead of walled garden SaaS apps.
* Reproducibly record deep learning experiments & data preparation workflows.
* Automated quality control protocols for data preparation and model performance.
* Runs anywhere; most research happens on laptops & HPCs, not in expensive clouds.
