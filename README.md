### Overview

* AIQC is an open source Python framework that brings rapid & reproducible deep learning workflows to open science.

  * [Mission = accelerate open science](https://aiqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mission.html): [1] Reduces the programming & data science know-how required to adopt deep learning. [2] Reproducibly records experiment workflows. [3] Provides a free alternative to walled gardens of expensive cloud SaaS.

  * [Tech = easy-to-use Python package](https://aiqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/notebooks/installation.html): [1] Provides best-practice guardrails in the form of an object-oriented API (e.g. Label, Hyperparamset, Job). [2] Simplifies data preprocessing, model tuning, and model scoring. [3] Prevents data leakage and evaluation bias. [4] Reproducibly persists experiments in a SQLite database file.
