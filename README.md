### Value Proposition

* AIQC is an open source Python package that simplifies data preparation and hyperparameter tuning for batches of deep learning models.

  * It *empowers researchers* by reducing the programming and data science know-how required to integrate machine learning into their research.

  * It makes machine learning less of a black box by *reproducibly recording experiments* in a file-based database that requires no configuration.
