# Dependencies. 
brew install pandoc
pip install nbsphinx, sphinx_copybutton, sphinx_rtd_theme, ipython

# Make after changes.
$ cd aiqc/docs
$ make html

# Then you can open 'aiqc/docs/_build/html' files in a browser.
# pip install sphinx-autobuild # Watch files instead of `make html`

# The notebooks and images all get duplicated. So after lots of changes, 
delete the `/_build` and rerun `make html`.

# Once pushed to github repo, it's auto watched for changes via ‘github incoming webhook’
