<h2>Purpose.<a class="headerlink" href="#purpose" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The AIQC framework brings rapid &amp; reproducible deep learning to open science. We strive to empower researchers with a free tool that is easy to integrate into their experiments. You can <a class="reference external" href="https://aiqc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mission.html">learn more about our mission here</a>.</p>
<p>Our initial goal is to build a guided framework for each major type of data (tabular, image, sequence, text, graph) and analysis (classify, quantify, generate).</p>
<p>Ultimately, we’d like to create specific preprocessing pipelines, pre-trained models, and visualizations for each major scientific domain in order to accelerate discovery.</p>

<p><a class="reference external" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-F-3E8pyjFo">Inspired by NumFOCUS leaders and ‘Google I/O 2008 - Open Source Projects and Poisonous People’</a></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><em>Be cordial and welcoming</em>; Communities are living, breathing social organisms where we can all learn to better ourselves while coming together to enact meaningful change.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Agree to disagree</em>; on one hand, acknowledge the merits of the ideas of others and be willing to adapt your opinion based on new information, but, on the other hand, <strong>do not</strong> sacrifice what you truly believe in for the sake of consensus.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Help educate &amp; mentor</em>; point people in the right direction to get started, but don’t continue to help those who won’t help themselves. Open source projects are a way for people to break out of their 9-5, so a lot of people are learning new things. In generally, be significantly less rigid than the StackOverflow community, but do ask people to state what they have tried, share their code, share their env, etc. Remember, AIQC is at the confluence of multiple disciplines, so err on the side of educating. English is also a 2nd language for many, so be patient.</p></li>
<li><p><em>Speaking about other technologies</em>; When you mention other tools, give them as much praise as you can for what they have done well. Don’t shy away from our benefits, but do take care to phrase your comparison politely. You never know who you will get connected with. For example, “We wanted our tool to be persistent and easy-to-use because that’s what it was going to take to get it into the hands of researchers. When we tried out other tools for ourselves as practicioners, we didn’t feel like they fully satisfied our criteria.”</p></li>
<li><p><em>Violations</em>; If you feel that certain behavior does not jive with the code of conduct, please report the instance to the community manager, Layne Sadler. In particular, any instance of either hate, harassment, or heinous prejudice will result in an immediate and permanent ban without the explicit need for a vote.</p></li>

<div><ul class="simple">
<li><p>“Governance in the early days was largely about reviewing PRs and asking ourselves, <em>‘Should we do this?’</em>”</p></li>
<li><p>“This is an unfortunate need, but you should have as part of it how someone can be removed from their role, voluntarily or otherwise.”</p></li>
<li><p>“In smaller projects, the leadership handles the quality of what’s brought into the project’s technical assets and shepherds the people.”</p></li>
</ul>

<li><p>The team can force any proposal submitted to the discussion board up to the council with a 2/3 vote (assuming there are at least 3 people on the team). However, rational discourse is preferred to forced votes.</p></li>

<h3>Choosing a license<a class="headerlink" href="#choosing-a-license" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="_images/license_badge.png"><img alt="OSI-BSD Badge" src="_images/license_badge.png" style="width: 20%;" /></a>
<p>AIQC is made open source under the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aiqc/aiqc/blob/main/LICENSE">Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) 3-Clause</a> license. This license is approved by the <a class="reference external" href="https://choosealicense.com/appendix/">Open Source Initiative (OSI)</a>, which is preferred by <a class="reference external" href="https://numfocus.org/projects-overview">NumFOCUS</a>. 3-Clause BSD is used by notable projects including: NumPy, Scikit-learn, Dask, Matplotlib, IPython, and Jupyter.</p>
<p>BSD is seen as a <em>permissive</em> license, as opposed to <em>restrictive</em>. The major implications are that people that incorporate AIQC into their work are <em>neither</em> obligated to release their source code as open source, nor restricted to publishing their work under the same license.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The simplest argument for AIQC adopting the BSD license is that AIQC uses upstream BSD projects. Therefore, it should pay it forward by using the same license and allowing others the same freedom it enjoys.</p>
<p>On one hand, the permissive nature of this license means that the cloud providers can fork this project and release it as their own closed source cloud service, which has been a recurring theme [<a class="reference external" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24799660">a</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/opensource/introducing-opensearch/">b</a>, etc.]. On the other hand, feedback from our friends in the Python community was that people would avoid using libraries with restrictive licenses, like AGPL, in their work. They explained that they aren’t allowed to open source their work and they “don’t want to get their legal team involved.” This begs the question, what good is being open source under a restrictive license if no one can <em>actually</em> use your software? Hopefully the cloud providers will put programs in place to contribute either code or profit (similar to App Store) back to the communities whose projects they fork.</p>
<p>Consideration of 4-Clause BSD; The <em>original</em> BSD license included an additional <em>advertising clause</em> that states: “All advertising materials mentioning features or use of this software must display the following acknowledgement: This product includes software developed by [].” Which helps, in part, to address the widespread complaint of, “If you are going to fork our project, at least give us a nod.” We’ve actually seen this play out at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.datto.com/">Datto</a>. The company used software written by StorageCraft and Oracle for years, and eventually they ended up adding a StorageCraft badge to their marketing collateral. It felt fair. However, the <em>advertising clause</em> of 4-Clause BSD made it officially incompatible with GPL-licensed projects and, in practice, 3-Clause BSD projects! The latter is the deciding factor. If we want to be a part of a BSD-based community, then we cannot hinder it.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The copyright section is modeled after the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/master/LICENSE">IPython</a> project.</p>
<p><em>Disclaimer; We still need to investigate BSD 3-Clause Clear and Apache 2.0 regarding patent &amp; trademark rights.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-core">
<h3>Open core<a class="headerlink" href="#open-core" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For the following reasons, AIQC plans to adopt an <em>open core</em> model in the long run:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Many successful open source projects have championed the open core model while managing to remain open:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Notable examples include: NumFOCUS JuliaLang - JuliaComputing, Apache Spark - Databricks, NumFOCUS Dask - Coiled &amp; SaturnCloud, Apache Zeppelin - Zepl, Apache Kafka - Confluent, GridAI - PyTorch Lightning, Dash &amp; Plotly - Plotly, MongoDB, RStudio.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In order to apply for certain government grant programs like the National Science Foundation (NSF) and DARPA (internet), it is <em>required</em> to form a business entity. Both JuliaLang and Dask have seen great success with this path. It has enabled them to tackle the most pressing, R&amp;D-intensive tasks (e.g. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/JuliaParallel/Dagger.jl#acknowledgements">Dagger.jl)</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Unfortunately, many grant application processes are explicitly reserved for individuals that are affiliated with esteemed institutions, which makes them off limits for everyday citizens.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>In reality, the continued success of many open source projects, even those that are not directly associated with a company, depends upon both funding and contributors coming from corporate sponsors with which they collaborate.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>This assistance naturally comes with a degree influence, sometimes formally in the shape of project governance positions. Forming your own company to help financially back the project helps the project creators have an equal seat at the table of sponsors.</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ga4gh.org/">Global Alliance for Genomics &amp; Health (GA4GH)]</a> eventually had to organize for legal protection.</p></li>
<li><p>Many biotech businesses offer either free or reduced pricing for students and academics as a healthy compromise.</p></li>
<li><p>It’s analogous to the <em>freemium</em> days of web 2.0 and apps. 95% of people get access to the free service while 5% of users pay for the premium options that solve their specific problems.</p></li>
<li><p>To paraphrase Isaacson’s, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.amazon.com/Innovators-Hackers-Geniuses-Created-Revolution/dp/1476708703">The Innovators</a>,: <em>“The first computer that was invented is sitting in a university basement in Iowa gathering dust. However, the 2nd computer was manufactured by IBM, and it sat on every professional desktop and point-of-sale counter in the world. It led the digital revolution.”</em></p></li>
